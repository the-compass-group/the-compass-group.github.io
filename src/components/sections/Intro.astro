            </Title>
            <Paragraph className="mt-6">
                Gregg Prockton is a CPA, CMA, and Certified Exit Planning Advisor (CEPA®) who helps business owners build companies that are worth more, with or without them. His work focuses on strengthening enterprise value by reducing owner dependence, closing operational gaps, and bringing clarity to where a business is truly going.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph className="mt-4">
                With over 30 years of experience as a business advisor, operator, and owner, Gregg brings a perspective shaped not just by theory, but by having started, operated, and successfully exited multiple small businesses himself. He understands firsthand that profit and activity alone do not create lasting value—clarity, intention, and disciplined execution do.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph className="mt-4">
                Gregg works with established business owners who are doing well but want to be more intentional about building durable, transferable businesses. His approach blends financial insight, strategic clarity, and practical execution, helping owners move from reactive decision-making to purpose-driven value creation, long before an exit is on the table.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph className="mt-4">
                Clients trust Gregg not only for the clarity and results he delivers, but because he leads with a simple principle: he cares more about their success than his own.
